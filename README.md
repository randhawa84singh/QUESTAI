# QuestAI

QuestAI is a gamified, AI-powered learning platform for primary and high-school students. It blends adaptive question generation with adventure-style progression so learners can "learn smarter and play harder."

## Overview
- **Adaptive AI learning:** Continuously adjusts question difficulty and study paths based on each learner's performance.
- **Gamification:** Points, levels, badges, streaks, daily quests, rewards, and leaderboards keep students motivated.
- **Quests & adventure mode:** Curriculum-aligned content is delivered as a game-like journey.
- **Progress tracking:** Dashboards give students, teachers, and parents insight into strengths and gaps across devices.
- **Cloud-first delivery:** Online presence enables real-time AI processing, synced progress, and fast updates.

## Target users
- Primary school students (8–12)
- High-school students (13–18)
- Learners who need motivation and parents seeking modern study tools
- Schools adopting digital education (Australia-first release, with expansion planned)

## Market positioning
QuestAI fills a gap between language-focused gamification apps and adaptive but non-gamified study tools. By combining adaptive learning, full-stack gamification, curriculum content, and adventure-style progression, it offers a differentiated experience compared to Duolingo, Khan Academy, Mathletics, and Quizlet.
